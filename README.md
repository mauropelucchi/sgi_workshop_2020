In this repository you can find the materials from the Workshop 2020 @ Data Mining course (STATISTICA E GESTIONE DELLE INFORMAZIONI - University of Milano Bicocca)

The workshop consists of two topics:

- [Cloud Platform for Data Science](https://github.com/mauropelucchi/sgi_workshop_2020/tree/master/cloud_data_science): in this section we present Google Colaboratory and Databricks
- Big Data in a real project

In the second topic, the workshop presents a notebook (on Databricks) about the training of a basic Machine Learning model, that covers:

- Load of the data and ETL process
